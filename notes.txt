Introduction
- This is a minimalist implementation of Raft to understand distributed concensus algorithms 
- Each node acts as a server with some data. 
- The leader is arbitrarily elected at the beginning 
- Each Node is associated with a distinct port on which it is listening for heartbeats, and also each port is broadcasting its heartbeats to a distinct port
